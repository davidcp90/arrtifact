In 2016, humankind decided to fight global warming by signing the Paris Climate agreement. 

All countries united their efforts to make sure the earth would not warm up more than 2 degrees. 

By early 2017, Mother Earth took measures of her own. Ancient volcanos, sleeping for thousands of years, rumbled at the bottom of our oceans. 

Tons of methane, reaching their pressure point, erupted from their open mouths in giant burps, filling our atmosphere with methane and carbon dioxide and dramatically changing the currents of the oceans. 

At this pace, within the next few years, the earth will warm up with 5 degrees and life as we know it will be gone forever…

There seems to be only one path towards Earth's recovery. 8 valuable, but well protected and hidden artifacts that might reverse the warming of the earth and save humankind..

Some are still fighting for Mother Earth’s last chance, others are trying to survive, while a few see an opportunity for themselves… 


What would you do?
